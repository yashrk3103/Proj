### *How to Test These in Your App:*
1. Copy any of these messages
2. Paste into your Streamlit app's text area
3. Click "Check Message"
4. Should show "ðŸš¨ SPAM DETECTED!" with high confidence (typically >90%)

*Note:* The exact detection depends on:
- What patterns exist in your spam.csv dataset
- How your model was trained
- The vectorizer's vocabulary coverage

For best results, ensure your training data (spam.csv) contains similar spam patterns. If any of these aren't detected as spam, you may need to retrain your model with more diverse spam examples.
